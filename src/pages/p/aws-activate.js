                        A dedicated stack is a deployment environment where you
                        are the sole tenant, to which Aptible automatically
                        applies and maintains the required security
                        configurations and SLAs needed for security, compliance
                        and availability. Each Aptible dedicated Stack runs in
                        its own private VPC. Dedicated Stacks are ideal for when
                        customers want to ingest regulated data like PHI, ensure
                        HIPAA and HITRUST compliance, or have stringent
                        availability and business continuity requirements.
