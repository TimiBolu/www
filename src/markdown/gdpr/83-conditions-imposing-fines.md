    (j) adherence to approved codes of conduct pursuant to [Article 40](/gdpr/articles/40-codes-of-conduct/) or approved certification mechanisms pursuant to [Article 42](/gdpr/articles/42-certification/); and

    (k) any other aggravating or mitigating factor applicable to the circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement.

4. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 10 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 2 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

5. Infringements of the following provisions shall, in accordance with paragraph 2, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher:

    (a) the basic principles for processing, including conditions for consent, pursuant to Articles [5](/gdpr/articles/5-processing-personal-data/), [6](/gdpr/articles/6-lawfulness-of-processing/), [7](/gdpr/articles/7-conditions-for-consent/) and [9](/gdpr/articles/9-processing-special-categories/);

    (b) the data subjects' rights pursuant to Articles [12](/gdpr/articles/12-transparent-communication/) to [22](/gdpr/articles/22-automated-decision-making/);

    (e) non-compliance with an order or a temporary or definitive limitation on processing or the suspension of data flows by the supervisory authority pursuant to [Article 58](/gdpr/articles/58-powers/)(2) or failure to provide access in violation of [Article 58](/gdpr/articles/58-powers/)(1).

6. Non-compliance with an order by the supervisory authority as referred to in [Article 58](/gdpr/articles/58-powers/)(2) shall, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, be subject to administrative fines up to 20 000 000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4 % of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.

7. Without prejudice to the corrective powers of supervisory authorities pursuant to [Article 58](/gdpr/articles/58-powers/)(2), each Member State may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in that Member State.

8. The exercise by the supervisory authority of its powers under this Article shall be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with Union and Member State law, including effective judicial remedy and due process.

9. Where the legal system of the Member State does not provide for administrative fines, this Article may be applied in such a manner that the fine is initiated by the competent supervisory authority and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect to the administrative fines imposed by supervisory authorities. In any event, the fines imposed shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. Those Member States shall notify to the Commission the provisions of their laws which they adopt pursuant to this paragraph by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment law or amendment affecting them.
