              We give you the “instruction manual” for what needs to be done to
              satisfy the requirements of your targeted frameworks. Each Workflow
              is mapped cleanly to your policies out of the box, and you can
              make customizations as needed.

          <h3 className={styles.number}>02</h3>
          <div>
            <p>
              As events are triggered, the “instruction manual” for that event
              kicks off the activities necessary to satisfy the appropriate policies.
            </p>
          </div>

            <p>
              The team responsible for completing the activities will receive
              an email notifying them that there is work to be completed. By
              logging into the app, they can see what needs to be done along
              with specific instructions.
            </p>

          <div>
            <p>
              The required activity is tracked and the assigned team member can
              mark it as complete, creating an audit-ready log of what’s been done.
