        <p className="XL">
          We challenge ourselves to create a tribe of startups that have access
          to great information security; are empowered to focus on their
          business, not on compliance; are able to scale their businesses faster
          and more efficiently and are confident that they are creating quality
          products.

        <p className="L">
          We understand that many companies are just starting on their compliance
          journey and may not fully understand information security. We believe
          that they should have access to compliance experts and best-in-class
          information security whether or not they have a security team.

        <h3>Empowerment</h3>
        <p className="L">
          Startups spend a great deal of time and money trying to achieve and
          maintain compliance when they should be focusing on other parts of
          their busienss. They need a solution that equips them with the tools
          and knowledge so they can achieve and own their compliance without
          burning resources.

      <div className={`${styles.bullet} ${styles.bulletLeft} ${styles.bulletBottom}`}>
        <h3>Scalability</h3>
        <p className="L">
          As companies scale, so do customer requirements for security. We
          believe that startups should have access to tools that scale with them
          and allow them to quickly and efficiently address thier internal and
          external security and complinace needs.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={`${styles.bullet} ${styles.bulletRight} ${styles.bulletBottom}`}>
        <h3>Confidence</h3>
        <p className="L">
          Startups have a lot to prove, and to succeed they need to build trust.
          We understand that having confidence in the stability of their product,
          the robustness of their security program, and the trutworthiness of
          their vendors equates to being able to speak confidently to customers
          and build trust.
